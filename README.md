# Thyroid cancer (THCA)

# Maren Schneider, Anna Lange, Jakob Then, David Matuschek


## abstract
In recent years bioinformatic methods became a tool of utmost importance in medical research. To detect specific gene and pathway patterns in different cancer types or histological types, here, we perform pan-cancer analysis. Furthermore, we carry out a focused analysis to specify different subcategories within a certain cancer type and to identify targets for therapy. As main methods in identifying up- or downregulated pathways, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) are used. GSVA of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression data, containing 33 different tumor types, reveals four clusters of cancer types, which are defined by different histological types like glioblastoma and adenocarcinoma. Thus, the histological types seem to correlate with a specific set of pathways that are especially enriched in certain types. Furthermore, GSVA results of Thyroid cancer (THCA) expression data show that thyroid carcinogenesis is associated with the upregulation of proliferation signaling pathways like the hedgehog pathway, alpha6beta4 integrin signaling pathway, and associated pathways such as interleukin 36 signaling. Based on those proliferation signaling pathways, three subclusters form inside the THCA patients from the pan-cancer data. One THCA subcluster could be linked to the follicular histological subtype and is defined by increased mTOR and MAPK activity while having low alpha6beta4 activity. In contrast, another THCA subcluster is defined by a low mTOR and MAPK activity, but a high alpha6beta4 activity. The third THCA subtype we identified shows both ways of proliferation signaling. These results promise more success in THCA treatment, as a more precise diagnosis of the distinct THCA subtypes is possible allowing for better treatment. To improve the understanding of THCA, and thereby bettering patientsâ€™ prognosis, this project focuses on finding genes that have a significantly altered expression in THCA compared to other cancers and especially to normal tissue.
