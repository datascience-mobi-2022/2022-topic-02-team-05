In the recent years bioinformatic methods became a tool of utmost importance in medical research. To detect specific gene and pathway patterns in different cancer types or histological types, a pan-cancer analysis is done. Furthermore, a focused analysis is done to specify different subcategories within a certain cancer type and to identify targets for therapy. As main methods in identifying up- or down-regulated pathways Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) are used. GSVA of The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression data, containing 33 different tumor types, reveals four clusters of cancer types, which are defined by different histological types like glioblastoma and adenocarcinoma. Thus, the histological types seem to correlate with a specific set of pathways that are especially enriched in certain types. Furthermore, GSVA results of Thyroid cancer expression data shows that thyroid carcinogenesis is associated with the up-regulation of proliferation signalling pathways like the hedgehog pathway, alpha6beta4 integrin signaling pathway and associated pathways such as interleukine 36 signaling. Also, the down-regulation of a pathway that is associated with an increased MAP-kinase activity goes along with carcinogenesis. Based on those proliferation signalling pathways, there are three subclusters that form inside of the thyorid cancer (THCA) patients from the pan-cancer data. One THCA subcluster that could be linked to the follicular histological subtype is defined by increased mTOR and MAPK activity, while having low alpha6beta4 activity. In contrast, another THCA subcluster is defined by a low mTOR and MAPK activity, but a high alpha6beta4 activity. The third THCA subtype is linked to enhanced activity of both of these proliferation signalling pathways. These results promise more success in THCA treatment, as a more precise diagnosis of the distinct THCA subtypes, and with this a more targeted therapy, is possible.
To improve the understanding of THCA, and thereby hopefully improve patients prognosis, this project focuses on finding genes that have a significantly different expression in THCA compared to other cancers and especially to normal tissue.
