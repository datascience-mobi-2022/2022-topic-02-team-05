In the recent years bioinformatic methods became a tool of utmost importance in medical research. To define specific genes and pathways in different cancer types or histological types pan-cancer analysis are done. A focused analysis is done to specify different subcategories within a certain cancer type and to identify targets for targeted therapy. The main methods in identifying up- or down-regulated pathways are GSEA and GSVA. GSVA of TCGA expression data reveals four clusters of cancer types, which are defined by different histological types like glioblastoma and adenocarcinoma. The histological types therefore seems to correlate with a specific set of pathways being especially enriched in certain cancer types. Furthermore, a GSVA of Thyroid cancer expression data shows that thyroid carcinogenisis is associated with the up-regulation of proliferative signalling pathways like the hedgehog pathway and alpha6beta4 integrin signaling pathway and associated pathways such as IL-36 signaling. It also showed the down-regulation of a pathway that is associated with an increased MAP-kinase acitivity. It is based on those proliferative signalling pathways that three subclusters form inside of the THCA patients from the pan-cancer data. One THCA subtype that could be linked to the follicular histological subtype is defined by increased mTOR and MAPK acitivity, while having low alpha6beta4 activity. In contrast another THCA subtype is defined by a low mTOR and MAPK activity, but a high alpha6beta4 activity. The third THCA subtype is linked to enhanced activity of both of these proliferative signalling pathways. These results promise better results is treatment, as a more percise diagnosis of the distinct THCA subtypse is possible
To improve the understanding of THCA and thereby hopefully improve patients prognosis, this project focuses on finding genes that have a significantly different expression in THCA compared to other cancers and especially to normal tissue.
