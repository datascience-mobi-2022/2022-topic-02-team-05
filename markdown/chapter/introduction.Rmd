# Introduction

In 2019 230,000 cancer deaths were documented in Germany xxx
\[[Krebsrate und Krebs-Sterberate in Deutschland
(krebsinformationsdienst.de)](https://www.krebsinformationsdienst.de/tumorarten/grundlagen/krebsstatistiken.php)\].
To detect and fight tumors, the development of new treatment and
detection methods is essential. For that it is beneficial to find a
similarities in mutational causes across different tumors by using
transcriptomic profiling methods like RNA-seq. In transcriptomic
profiling all the RNA that has been generated by transcription of a
cells DNA is sequenced [@cell].

## Hallmarks of cancer

The Hallmarks of Cancer are properties of tumors, that can be detected
in each tumor. Among others those are: resisting cell death, inducing
angiogenesis, enabling replicative immortality, activating invasion and
metastasis evading growth suppressors were the first detected hallmarks
[@cancer_hallmarks].

## Histological tumor types

The observed tumors can be classified into different histological types.
Carcinoma, which can be further subcategorized into adenocarcinomas,
squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma. Carcioma derive
from epithelial cells. Melanoma are skin tumors, sarcoma derive from
connective or supportive tissue cells, glioblastoma are brain tumors and
leukemia affect bloodcells [@cell].

## RNA-sequencing

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is performed by cleaning of RNA, fragmentation,
translation of RNA to cDNA, sequencing of cDNA and comparison with a
reference genome. The advantage of RNA-seq is that it includes
information about gene expression that is especially important in the
analysis of tumors such as epigenetic changes (e.g. epigenetic gene
silencing) or fusion proteins [@cell].

The results from RNA-seq used for the analysis stem from data from the
cancer genome atlas (TCGA).

## Thyroid carcinoma

Thyroid carcinoma (THCA) incidence increased dramatically over the past
few years [@THCA]. The main tasks of the thyroid gland are synthesizing
hormones and regulating body temperate and metabolism [@THgland1]. Most
THCA derive from thyroid cells and result in the thyroid gland losing
its function. Thyroid cancer can occur in two different types,
differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Those two types
again have histological subtypes. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the
most common THCA, follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and a tall cell
variant (TCV) are subtypes of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
Medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer are subtypes of undifferentiated
thyroid cancer (UTC). Prevalence of DTCs is clearly higher than of UTCs
[@THCA2]. Regarding the presented DTCs, PTCs have the best clinical
prognosis [@PCA1], while TCV cancers have the worst clinical outcome
[@PCA_aggressive]. Therefore, the detection of the tumor type would be
important and for more specific therapy options. Even though, all
thyroid cancers are treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine,
the additional therapy differs for each histological type [@PCA3].

#### Integrin

Integrin is a cellular adhesion molecule, that binds to laminin in the
extracellular matrix [@integrin1]. Together with other proteins they
form hemidesmosomes. Thereby, integrin is essential for the integrity
between cells. An important step in the development of malignant cancer
is the invasion into healthy tissue. Thus, the detachment of the
extracellular matrix from of the surrounding cells is essential.

## Computational tools

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To analyse how the activity of a gene set differs between two sets of
gene expression data, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is
performed. For this, the genes in the expression data have to be ranked
decreasingly by a certain metric. Such metrics can include the log2 fold
change between the sample expression data and a reference set or the
associated p-values for each gene. After ranking, a cumulative sum of
all expression values in the ranked sample is computed. If a gene is
present in the gene set to be analysed the expression value of that gene
is added to the running sum. However, if the current gene does not lie
in the gene set the value is subtracted. The extremum of this running
sum is termed the enrichment score of the gene set. It is positive if
the gene set is overexpressed in the sample compared to the reference
data and negative vice versa. [@GSEA]

### Gene Set Variation Analysis

The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is performed with the same
intention as the GSEA - to analyse the pathway activities from gene
expression data. Like the GSEA, the approach helps to reduce noise, to
further reduce dimensions and to improve the interpretation process
[@GSVA]. The difference to the GSEA is that there is no reference
expression data required to perform the GSVA.

### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction

The Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension
reduction (UMAP) is a method to reduce the dimension of a
multidimensional data set. In comparison to the PCA, UMAP can reduce
dimensions where the data is not linear [@UMAP]. Thereby, the high
dimensional structure of the data is maintained. In further
visualization, the structure can be represented in clusters that would
not be visible using PCA. Thereby, the identification of the clusters is
a lot easier and the UMAP keeps the overall structure of the data set,
which makes clustering easier. The disadvantage of the UMAP is that
although the overall structure is conserved, the distance between the
individual points is not proportional to the real distance in the data
set. This arises from the non-linear dimensional reduction.

### Principal component analysis xxx QUELLE

A Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of
a given data set. The dimensions are summarized in principal components
(PCs) which do not correlate. Because the PCs summarize the dimensions,
the first PCs explain most of the variance of the data set and thereby
can be selected to explain the data. Still, one has to keep in mind,
that by reducing the dimensions, not all of the variance is explained
and some of the information is lost in the process. The ideal number of
PCs can be determined with an elbow-plot. In our analysis we use a PCA
as a foundation for the UMAP, because the UMAP can not work with
correlated dimensions. Furthermore it is used to detect the most
important pathways, which explain most of the variance in the first PCs.

A PCA is performed for the pan cancer analysis on the TCGA gene
expression data, to find similarities and differences in pathway
activity for each tumor type. Furthermore a PCA is performed for the
focused analysis of THCA tissue and normal tissue.

### Jaccard index

The Jaccard index is the intersection, divided by the union of two sets.
Therefore, it can be used to identify the similarity of the sets.

## Pan Cancer Analysis

For the pan cancer analysis 3 data sets are provided. One containing
expression data of 60,000 genes in 10,000 tumor patients. Another one
contains clinical annotations concerning those patients and the last one
contains hallmark pathways and their included genes. In the following
analysis the data is cleaned by removing NAs, biotype filtering and
low-variance filtering. After that a descriptive analysis is performed.
After that a gene set variation analysis to detect significantly altered
pathways compared to the other pathways in tumor tissue and a linear
regression analysis is performed to predict pathway activity based on
other pathways??? xxx Furthermore a neuronal network is built to improve
prediction.

## Focused analysis on THCA patients

An analysis of THCA patients is performed. This analysis is done on a
data set containing the gene expression data of 60 patients in tumor an
normal tissue and their clinical annotations. First the data is cleaned
and described like the pan cancer data to prepare the data for the gene
set variation analysis. GSVA is performed on the THCA data in the bigger
pan cancer data set, to confirm results from the smaller data set. In
this analysis a linear regression analysis is performed to predict the
activity of other pathways based on thyroxine biosynthesis (nicht
mehr!!!!) xxx. A better prediction can be achieved with a neuronal
network.

## Linear regression analysis

Linear regression is a statistical model that uses measurable values to
predict an outcome. For this purpose, a linear function serves as basis
to built the linear regression equation [@lm]. In gene expression data
analysis a linear regression equation can be used to predict the
activity of one gene (or pathway) by the activity of another.

### Neural network

A neural network was performed using the package "neuralnet"
\[@neuralnet\]. In general, a deep learning network consists of an input
layer, multiple hidden layers and an output layer [@neuronal]. Each one
consisting of various neurons. The input layer contains as much neurons
as input numbers are given for each sample. The output layer contains as
much neurons as possible outputs. The number of neurons in each hidden
layer and the number of hidden layers vary and will be determined for
the best results. Based on the input numbers in the input layer, the
number of each neuron of the next layer is determined, based on a linear
regression model composed of the input data, weights, and bias.

$$
\sum_{i=1} ^{n} w_i x_i + bias
$$

*n* is the number of input neurons and *w* the weight.

To obtain numbers in the range of 0 and 1, a min/max-scaling is
performed on the input data. Furthermore, the optimal number of neurons
per layer and the best random weights and biases for the first sample
must be determined. This is done because some weights and biases may
result in finding a local, but not global minimum of the cost function.
After determining the random weights and bias, which resulted in a
random output for the first sample, the cost function is calculated. To
minimize the cost, resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking is
used. Therefore, the gradient function of the cost function is
determined. In resilient backpropagation, only the sign of the derivate
is used, to avoid harmful effects of its magnitude. For minimizing the
cost function, the ideal weights and biases are determined, based on the
input and the expected output. (Theoretisch kann man hier ja noch
schreiben, dass nicht nur das Erreichen des Minimums, sondern auch die
Geschwindigkeit für das Erreichen des Minimums relevant sind) xxx. For
the next samples those steps are repeated to reach the minimum of the
cost function.

$$
Cost function = \frac {1}{2m} \sum_{i=1} ^{m} (x - y)^2
$$

*m* is the number of samples, *y* the output and *x* the expected
output.
