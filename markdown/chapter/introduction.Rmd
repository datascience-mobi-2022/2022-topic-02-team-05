# Introduction

In 2019, 230,000 humans died from cancer in Germany xxx \[[Krebsrate und
Krebs-Sterberate in Deutschland
(krebsinformationsdienst.de)](https://www.krebsinformationsdienst.de/tumorarten/grundlagen/krebsstatistiken.php)\].
To detect and fight tumors, the development of new treatment and
detection methods is essential. Therefore it is inevitable to find a
tumors mutational cause. Therefore transcriptomic profiling methods like
RNA-seq can be used.

The provided data in the following analysis originates from
transcriptomic profiling methods like RNA-seq. Transcriptomic profiling
sequences all the RNA that has been generated by transcription of a
cells DNA. The difference to sequencing of DNA is, that it only
sequences those genes, that are going to be expressed in that cell
[@cell].

## Hallmarks of cancer

The Hallmarks of Cancer are properties of tumors, that can be detected
in each tumor. Among others resisting cell death, inducing angiogenesis,
enabling replicative immortality, activating invasion and metastasis
evading growth suppressors were the first detected hallmarks
[@cancer_hallmarks].

## Histological tumor types

The observed tumors can be classified into different histological types.
Carcinomas contain adenocarcinomas, Squamous cell carcinoma,
transitional cell carcinoma and carcinomas in general, which include all
of the mixed carcinomas. Carciomas derive from epithelial cells.
Melanoma is a tumor of the skin, a sarcoma derives from connective or
supportive tissue cells. A glioblastoma is a tumor in the brain and
leukemia affects the blood [@cell].

## RNA-sequencing

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is performed by cleaning of RNA, fragmentation,
translation of RNA to cDNA, sequencing of cDNA and comparing with the
reference genome. The advantage of RNA-seq is that it includes
information about gene expression that is especially important in the
analysis of tumors such as epigenetic changes (e.g. epigenetic gene
silencing) or fusion proteins [@cell].

The results from RNA-seq used for the analysis originate from the cancer
genome atlas (TCGA).

## Thyroid carcinoma

Thyroid carcinoma (THCA) incidence increased dramatically over the past
few years [@THCA]. To enlarge the understanding of THCA and thereby
hopefully improve patients prognosis, this project focuses on finding
genes that have a significantly different expression in THCA compared to
other cancers and especially to normal tissue.
The main tasks of the
thyroid gland are synthesizing hormones and regulating body temperate
and metabolism [@THgland1]. A lack of thyroid hormones can cause
symptoms like headaches, nausea and depression. Most THCAs derive from
thyroid cells and thereby the thyroid gland loses their function,
resulting in a lack of thyroid hormones.
Thyroid cancer can occur in
two different types, differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer.
Those two types again have histological subtypes. Papillary thyroid
cancer (PTC), the most common THCA, follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and
tall cell variant cancer (TCV) are subtypes of differentiated thyroid
cancer (DTC) while medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer are subtypes
of undifferentiated thyroid cancer (UTC). Prevalence of DTCs is clearly
higher than of UTCs [@THCA2].
Regarding the presented DTCs, PTCs have
the best clinical prognosis [@PCA1], while TCV cancers have the worst
clinical outcome [@PCA_aggressive]. Therefore, the detection of the
tumor type would be important and for more specific therapy options.
Even though, all thyroid cancers are treated with thyroidectomy and
radioactive iodine, the additional therapy differs for each histological
type [@PCA3].

#### Integrin

Integrins are cellular adhesion molecules that bind to laminins in the extracellular matrix [@integrin1]. Together with other proteins, they form hemidesmosomes. Thereby, integrins are essential for the attachment of tissue cells. 
An important step in the development of malignant cancers is the invasion into healty tissue. Thus, the detachment of the extracellular matrix and of the surrounding cells is essential. 


## Computational tools

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To analyse and compare the activity of pathways of gene expression data,
a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is performed. The aim of the GSEA
is to analyse and to identify highly expressed pathways [@GSEA]. For
this, two conditions with replicates are compared, so a reference of
normal expression data is needed.
First, a gene list is defined. Then the statistically enriched pathways are identified and lastly, the results are visualized.

### Gene Set Variation Analysis

The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is performed with the same
intention as the GSEA, so to analyse the pathway activities from gene
expression data. Like the GSEA, the approach helps to reduce noise, to
further reduce dimensions and to improve the interpretation process
[@GSVA]. The difference to the GSEA is that there no reference
expression data is to perform the GSVA.

### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction

The Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension
reduction (UMAP) is a method to reduce the dimension of a
multidimensional data set. In comparison to the PCA, UMAP can reduce
dimensions where the data is not linear [@UMAP]. Thereby, the high
dimensional structure of the data is maintained. In further
visualization, the structure can be represented in clusters that would
not be visible using PCA. Therefore, the identification of the clusters
is a lot easier. is Thereby the UMAP keeps the overall structure of the
data set, therefore clusters are easier.
The problem of the UMAP is that although the overall structure is conserved, the distance between
the individual points is not proportional to the real distance in the
data set. This arises from the non-linear dimensional reduction.

### Principal component analysis xxx QUELLE

A Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of
a given data set. The dimensions are summarized in principal components
(PCs) which do not correlate. Because the PCs summarize the dimensions,
the first PCs explain most of the variance of the data set and thereby
can be selected to explain the data. Still, one has to keep in mind,
that by reducing the dimensions, not all of the variance is explained
and some of the information is lost in the process. The ideal number of
PCs can be determined with an elbow-plot. In our analysis we use a PCA
as a foundation for the UMAP, because the UMAP can not work with
correlated dimensions. Furthermore it is used to detect the most
important pathways, which explain most of the first PCs.

In the analysis, a PCA is performed for the pan cancer analysis on the
TCGA gene expression data, to find similarities and differences in
pathway activity for each tumor type. Furthermore a PCA is performed for
the focused analysis of THCA and normal tissue.

### Jaccard index

The Jaccard index is the intersection, divided by the union of two sets.
Therefore, it can be used to identify the similarity of the sets.

## Pan Cancer Analysis

For the pan cancer analysis 3 data sets are provided. One containing
expression data of 60,000 genes in 10,000 tumor patients, another one
with clinical annotations concerning those patients and one with
hallmark pathways and their included genes. In the following analysis
this data is cleaned by removing NAs, biotype filtering and low-variance
filtering. After that a descriptive analysis is performed. Those two
steps lead to the actual analysis, a gene set variation analysis to
detect significantly altered pathways compared to the other pathways in
tumor tissue. In the end a linear regression analysis is performed to
predict pathway activity based on other pathways??? xxx Furthermore a
neuronal network is built to improve prediction.

## Focused analysis on THCA patients

Furthermore a analysis of THCA patients is performed. For this analysis
a data set containing the gene expression of 60 patients in tumor an
normal tissue and their clinical annotations. First the data is cleaned
and described like the pan cancer data, to prepare the data for the gene
set variation analysis, which is also performed for the THCA data in the
bigger pan cancer data set, to confirm results from the smaller data
set. In this analysis a linear regression analysis is performed to
predict the activity of thyroxine biosynthesis. The results are also
improved with a neuronal network.

## Linear regression analysis

Linear regression is a statistical model that uses measurable values to predict an outcome. For this purpose, a linear function serves as basis to built the linear regression equation [@lm]. 
In gene expression data analysis, constructing a linear regression equation can be used to predict the activity of one gene (or pathway) by the activity of another.

### Neural network

Implementing a neural network was performed with the package "neuralnet" [@neuralnet].

In general, a deep learning network consists of a input layer, multiple
hidden layers and an output layer [@neuronal]. Each one consisting of various
neurons. The input layer contains as much neurons as input numbers are
given for each sample. The output layer contains as much neurons as
possible outputs. The number of neurons in each hidden layer and the
number of hidden layers vary and will be determined for the best
results.

Based on the input numbers in the input layer, the number of each neuron
of the next layer is determined, based a linear regression model
composed of the input data, weights, and bias.

$$
\sum_{i=1} ^{n} w_i x_i + bias
$$

*n* is the number of input neurons and *w* the weight.

To obtain numbers in the range of 0 and 1, a min max scaling is
performed on the input data. Furthermore, the optimal number of neurons
per layer and the best random weights and biases for the first sample
must be determined, because some weights and biases may result in
finding a local, but not global minimum of the cost function.

After determining the random weights and bias, which resulted in a
random output for the first sample, the cost function is calculated. To
minimize the cost, resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking is
used. Therefore, the gradient function of the cost function is
determined. In resilient backpropagation, only the sign of the derivate
is used, to avoid harmful effects of its magnitude. For minimizing the
cost function, the ideal weights and biases are determined, based on the
input and the expected output. (Theoretisch kann man hier ja noch
schreiben, dass nicht nur das Erreichen des Minimums, sondern auch die
Geschwindigkeit für das Erreichen des Minimums relevant sind).

For the next samples those steps are repeated to reach the minimum of
the cost function.

$$
Cost function = \frac {1}{2m} \sum_{i=1} ^{m} (x - y)^2
$$

*m* is the number of samples, *y* the output and *x* the expected
output.
