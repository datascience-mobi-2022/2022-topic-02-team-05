# Introduction

## Biological background

In 2019 230,000 cancer deaths were documented in
Germany\footnote{ https://www.krebsinformationsdienst.de/tumorarten/grundlagen/krebsstatistiken.php}.
To detect and fight tumors, the development of new treatment and
detection methods is essential. For that it is beneficial to find a
similarities in mutational causes across different tumors by using
transcriptomic profiling methods like RNA-seq. In transcriptomic
profiling all the RNA that has been generated by transcription of a
cells DNA is sequenced [@cell].

The Hallmarks of Cancer are properties of tumors, that can be detected
in each tumor. Among others those are: resisting cell death, inducing
angiogenesis, enabling replicative immortality, activating invasion and
metastasis evading growth suppressors were the first detected hallmarks
[@cancer_hallmarks].

The observed tumors can be classified into different histological types.
Carcinoma, which can be further subcategorized into adenocarcinomas,
squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma. Carcioma derive
from epithelial cells. Melanoma are skin tumors, sarcoma derive from
connective or supportive tissue cells, glioblastoma are brain tumors and
leukemia affect bloodcells [@cell].

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is performed by cleaning of RNA, fragmentation,
translation of RNA to cDNA, sequencing of cDNA and comparison with a
reference genome. The advantage of RNA-seq is that it includes
information about gene expression that is especially important in the
analysis of tumors such as epigenetic changes (e.g. epigenetic gene
silencing) or fusion proteins [@cell]. The results from RNA-seq used for
the analysis stem from data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA).

Thyroid carcinoma (THCA) incidence increased dramatically over the past
few years [@THCA]. The main tasks of the thyroid gland are synthesizing
hormones and regulating body temperate and metabolism [@THgland1]. Most
THCA derive from thyroid cells and result in the thyroid gland losing
its function. Thyroid cancer can occur in two different types,
differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Those two types
again have histological subtypes. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the
most common THCA, follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and a tall cell
variant (TCV) are subtypes of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
Medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer are subtypes of undifferentiated
thyroid cancer (UTC). Prevalence of DTCs is clearly higher than of UTCs
[@THCA2]. Regarding the presented DTCs, PTCs have the best clinical
prognosis [@PCA1], while TCV cancers have the worst clinical outcome
[@PCA_aggressive]. Therefore, the detection of the tumor type would be
important and for more specific therapy options. Even though, all
thyroid cancers are treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine,
the additional therapy differs for each histological type [@PCA3].

Integrin is a cellular adhesion molecule, that binds to laminin in the
extracellular matrix [@integrin1]. Together with other proteins they
form hemidesmosomes. Thereby, integrin is essential for the integrity
between cells. An important step in the development of malignant cancer
is the invasion into healthy tissue. Thus, the detachment of the
extracellular matrix from of the surrounding cells is essential and
alterations of integrin are very common in cancer cells [@integrin2].

## Computational tools

To analyse how the activity of a gene set differs between two sets of
gene expression data, a GSEA is
performed. For this, the genes in the expression data have to be ranked
decreasingly by a certain metric. Such metrics can include the log2 fold
change between the sample expression data and a reference set or the
associated p-values for each gene. After ranking, a cumulative sum of
all expression values in the ranked sample is computed. If a gene is
present in the gene set to be analysed the expression value of that gene
is added to the running sum. However, if the current gene does not lie
in the gene set the value is subtracted. The extremum of this running
sum is termed the enrichment score of the gene set. It is positive if
the gene set is overexpressed in the sample compared to the reference
data and negative vice versa. [@GSEA]

The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is performed with the same
intention as the GSEA - to analyse the gene set activities in gene
expression data. However, no reference data is required to successfully
perform GSVA. There are various approaches to GSVA, one of them is
performed by [@GSVA] by following five steps. First, the cumulative
density distribution of a gene over all samples is estimated. Then the
expression statistic of a gene in a sample based on the cumulative
density distribution is calculated to bring all of the expression values
to the same level. The third step is to rank the genes based on the
expression statistic and to normalize the ranks with z-transformation.
Lastly, the enrichment score is computed based on the obtained ranked
list by calculating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like rank statistic for each
gene set. [@GSVA]

A Principal component analysis (PCA) xxx QUELLE is used to alter the
coordinates of a given dataset to its eigenvectors. This matrix rotation
results in a new set of basis vectors called principal components (PCs)
- the eigenvectors - that are orthogonal and show little correlation.
Sorting the PCs by their associated eigenvalue, sthe PCs explaining the
most variance can easily be identified, as they have the highest
eigenvalue. By displaying the data set in a coordinate system span by
the n most variant PCs, the dimensionalty of the dataset is reduced to
$\mathbb{R}^n$ with the lowest loss in variance.

The Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension
reduction (UMAP) is a method to reduce the dimension of a
multidimensional data set. Compared to PCA, UMAP preserves the global
structure of the data better and is much faster than other comparable
techniques like t-SNE [@tSNE]. The algorithm starts by setting up a
high-dimensional graph representation of the data. From each data point,
a radius is extended and when two radii come into contact the points are
connected in the graph. The radius is chosen individually for each point
based on the distance to the nearest neighbor. The algorithm goes on
until k points are connected or n iterations are reached. The resulting
clustered high-dimensional graph is then optimized for a visualization
in low-dimensions. A disadvantage of UMAP is that although the overall
structure is conserved, the distances between the individual points are
not proportional to the real distance in the data set. This arises from
the non-linear dimensional reduction. [@UMAP]

The Jaccard index is the intersection, divided by the union of two sets.
Therefore, it can be used to identify the similarity of the sets.

Linear regression is a statistical model that uses measurable values to
predict an outcome. For this purpose, a linear function serves as basis
to build the linear regression equation \[@lm\]. The coefficients for
each variable are estimated by their correlation and slope with the
predicted parameter. Lastly, all coefficients as well as the intersect
are optimized for the data set with a least sum of squares method.

As an alternative to the linear regression a neuronal network can be
used. In general, a deep learning network consists of an input layer,
multiple hidden layers, and an output layer consisting of various
neurons [@neuronal]. The input layer contains as much neurons as input
numbers are given for each sample. The output is for a regression
analysis a singular neuron. The number of neurons in each hidden layer
and the number of hidden layers vary and must be tested to give best
results. The activation of each neuron can be described as a linear
composition of all the inputs $x_i$ from the previous layer associated
with a weight $w_i$ and a bias:$$
Activation = \sum_{i=1} ^{n} w_i x_i + bias
$$To obtain neuron activations in the range of 0 and 1, a
min/max-scaling is performed on the input data. The "learning effect" of
the network is achieved by optimizing the randomly chosen weights and
biases via gradient decent. To do so, for each training iteration the
error of the network is computed by a cost function:$$
Cost function = \frac {1}{2m} \sum_{i=1} ^{m} (x - y)^2
$$

*m* is the number of samples, *y* the output and *x* the expected
output.

Next, the cost function value must be reduced. Therefore, its gradient
is computed, and all weights and biases are adjusted accordingly in a
process called backpropagation. In resilient backpropagation, only the
sign of the gradient is used, to avoid harmful effects of its magnitude.
For the next samples those steps are repeated to reach the minimum of
the cost function. A drawback of this method is that gradient decent
only identifies local minima of the cost function. To find a global
minimum the training has to be repeated with various initial weights and
biases. After such a minimum is identified to network performs optimally
for the data set.

## The analysis

For the pan cancer analysis 3 data sets are provided. One containing
expression data of 60,000 genes in 10,000 tumor patients. Another one
contains clinical annotations concerning those patients and the last one
contains hallmark pathways and their included genes. In the following
analysis the data is cleaned by removing NAs, biotype filtering and
low-variance filtering. After that a descriptive analysis is performed.
After that a gene set variation analysis to detect significantly altered
pathways compared to the other pathways in tumor tissue and a linear
regression analysis is performed to predict pathway activity based on
other pathways??? xxx Furthermore a neuronal network is built to improve
prediction.

An analysis of THCA patients is performed. This analysis is done on a
data set containing the gene expression data of 60 patients in tumor an
normal tissue and their clinical annotations. First the data is cleaned
and described like the pan cancer data to prepare the data for the gene
set variation analysis. GSVA is performed on the THCA data in the bigger
pan cancer data set, to confirm results from the smaller data set. In
this analysis a linear regression analysis is performed to predict the
activity of other pathways based on thyroxine biosynthesis (nicht
mehr!!!!) xxx. A better prediction can be achieved with a neuronal
network.
