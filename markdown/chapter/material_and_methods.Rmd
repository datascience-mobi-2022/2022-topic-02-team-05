# Materials and Methods

For the means of this project two separate analysis are performed: a
pan-cancer analysis focusing on differences between cancer types and a
focused analysis investigating THCA.

## Description of the underlying data

For the analysis four data sets were provided. For pan-cancer analysis a
gene expression data frame with normalized and log2 transformed bulk
RNA-seq expression data for 60,489 genes in 9741 patients with 33
different forms of cancer was used. The data was derived from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). Complementing the TCGA expression data is an
annotation dataframe with 37 clinical annotations regarding tumor type,
tumor stage, gender, age, etc. for all patients.

The third object is a list containing five lists for the focused
analysis, one list for each tumor type (BRCA, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD, THCA).
For our focused analysis, the only the THCA data were used. The THCA
list consists of three data frames: The first two contain normalized and
log2 transformed bulk RNA-seq expression data for 19,624 genes in 59
THCA patients for carcinogenic and homeostatic tissue. The third
dataframe complementes the data with the respective clinical
annotations.

The last object contains 46 pathways associated with the hallmarks of
cancer in form of a list of string vectors.

## Metabolic pathway selection

To perform enrichment analysis later on, 6366 canonical pathways were
selected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)\[@msigdb\] with
the `msigdbr::msigdbr()` function. As not to introduce a bias during
enrichment analysis, the similarity of MSigDB pathways among themselves
as well as with the hallmark pathways was computed with the Jaccard
index. Pathways with a Jaccard index greater than the 1$\sigma$ range
were discarded.

## Preprocessing of expression data

### Data cleaning

All expression data were checked for missing values with the `na.omit()`
function. Subsequently, low variance filtering was performed for TCGA
and THCA tumor expression data. The variances of expression were
computed for every gene across all samples and then, genes with
variances blow a threshold were discarded to reduce dimensionality.

### Biotype filtering

Next, biotype filtering was performed for pan-cancer and THCA expression
data to reduce dimensionality further. Only genes sharing biotypes with
the hallmark pathways were kept for the the following analysis. The
biotypes of the genes were retrieved using the `biomart::getBM()`
function from the biomaRt package [@biomart]. To allow for an
appropriate comparison within all pathways, only MSigDB pathways where
over 99% of their respective genes were present in the filtered
expression data were selected as final pathways.

## Methods for descriptive analysis

### Mean-variance plot

In a mean-variance plot the variance is plotted over the mean of
expression values of single genes across all patients. Thus, the
variance and mean were calculated for each gene in the THCA expression
data. The final plot was created with the package ggplot2 \ref{ggplot2}.

### KANN RAUS m.M.n Violin plot

To check the distribution of a data set and compare it with other data
sets violin plots are used. Based on how similar the violin plots are,
it can be implied that the data is normalized. Violin plots are tilted
and mirrored density plots of gene expression values. The y-axis shows
the gene expression value and the x-axis shows the amount of genes with
a certain gene expression value.

### Jaccard-Index

The Jaccard-Index is a method to describe the similarity between two
quantities. To compute it, the intersection of all gene ENSEMBL-IDs from
two compared pathways was divided by their union. We used this method to
determine the degree in which pathways are similar to each other.

### Volcano plot

A volcano plot is used to identify genes displaying significantly
different expression in carcinogenic versus homeostatic tissues. First,
the log2 fold change (Log2FC) is calculated for each gene across all
samples in the THCA expression data in the following way:

$$
log2FC = mean(normal tissue) - mean(tumor tissue)
$$Next, a two-sided t-test was performed with the `t.test()` function to
determine the significance of a difference in expression. To avoid the
accumulation of type one errors, a Bonferroni correction was performed.
n is the number of genes in the cleaned data set for focused analysis:

$$
\alpha = \frac{0.025}{n}
$$

In the volcano plot the -log10 of the calculated p-values is plotted
against die Log2FC. Genes with a lower p-value than the corrected
significance level $\alpha$ are significantly differently expressed. If
the Log2FC is additionally positive, the genes are significantly
overexpressed in tumor tissue, if the Log2FC is negative, the genes are
significantly underexpressed in tumor tissue.

## Dimension reduction and pathway enrichment analysis

### Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

For the PCA, the data obtained by the GSEA (tumor vs normal) or by GSVA
(pan cancer) was used. After performing the PCA, the results were
plotted to visualize the different clusters.

The PCA was performed for analyzing pathway and gene activity. PCA is
performed by the built in r-function prcomp().

### **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (**UMAP)

Like PCA, UMAP is a technique to reduce dimensions and to understand and
visualize high dimensional data sets. Compared to PCA, UMAP better
preserves the global structure and is much faster than other comparable
techniques (for example t-SNE \cite{xxx}). The algorithm starts by
setting up a high-dimensional graph representation of the data. From
each data point, a radius is extended and when two radii come into
contact the points are connected. The radius is chosen individually for
each point based on the distance to the nearest neighbor. The algorithm
does not stop before every point is not connected at least to its
closest neighbor. The resulting clustered high-dimensional graph is then
optimized for a visualization in low-dimensions. Using this technique,
the pan-cancer data is visualized. UMAP is performed with the package
"umap" [@umap].

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

The GSEA is used to identify enriched pathways in tumor tissue. Next to
the tumor tissue data, the THCA data includes also a normal tissue gene
expression data frame which is used as a reference for activity
comparison.

GSEA is performed with the package "fgsea" [@fgsea]. First, the log2FC
is calculated for every gene of each each patient and is then ranked in
a vector. This vector begins with the highest log2FC and ends with the
lowest. A high log2FC implies that the this gene is higher expressed in
tumor tissue compared to normal tissue in this particular patient.

Using the ranked log2FC vectors, the activity of each pathway for the
patient is calculated. By iterating over every gene of the ranked
vector, it was checked if it lies or does not lie in a particular
pathway. If a gene lies in the pathway, the log2FC value is summed up to
a running sum. If the gene does not lie in the pathway, the log2FC value
is subtracted from the running sum. Therefore, when a pathway is highly
expressed compared to normal tissue, the the running sum scores a high
value in the beginning and decreases to the end of the iteration. This
results in a cumulative function that has a peak at a certain place. At
this index of the ranked vector, the expression value of the
corresponding gene is taken as the enrichment score of the analysed
pathway and the patient belonging to the used vector. This process is
then repeated for each pathway and each patient.

### Geneset Variation Analysis (GSVA)

Next to the GSEA, the GSVA is an approach to identify the pathway
activities from gene expression data. Differently to the GSEA, it does
not need a reference data frame to compare to. Hence, there was no
expression data provided for comparison in the TCGA analysis, GSVA was
used. There are various solutions to perform GSVA, one of them is
performed by @GSVA by following those five steps. For performing a GSVA,
firstly the cumulative density distribution of a gene over all samples
is estimated. Then the expression statistic of a gene in a sample based
on the cumulative density distribution is calculated to bring all of the
expression values to the same level. The third step is to rank the genes
based on the expression statistic and to normalize the ranks with
z-transformation. The last step is to compute the enrichment score based
on the obtained ranked list. Therefore the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like rank
statistic is calculated for each gene set. That is used to calculate the
enrichment score for each pathway in each patient, which is shown a
heatmap [@GSVA].

GSVA is performed with the package "GSVA" [@gsva].

### KANN RAUS m.M.n Figure X

To identify pathways with the highest p-Value, obtained from GSVA and
t-testing, a figure x is generated.

For generating figure x, the data from generating a volcano plot is used
to identify the pathways, that are significantly over- or underexpressed
based on the p-value. Pathways with a p-value smaller than 0.025 and a
log2FC bigger than zero are significantly overexpressed, if the log2FC
is smaller than zero, the pathways are significantly underexpressed. In
the next step, the pathways are ranked based on their p-value and the
-log10(p-value) of each pathways is plotted against its rank. One plot
is generated for overexpressed pathways and the other one for under
expressed pathways.

### Linear Regression

A linear regression analysis is performed to predict the activity of xxx
based on the activity of the other pathways.

Firstly, the correlation of the pathways for predicting is checked, only
pathways with a low correlation were kept. In the next step, the
variance is checked, 80% of the genes with low variance were omitted.

For the regression analysis only 20% of the pathways were used, to only
use significant pathways.

The regression analysis was tested by

### Neuronal Network

A neural network was used to predict the activity of
REACTOME_INTERLEUKIN_36_PATHWAY based on the activity of other pathways.
Therefore, the network was trained with the pathway activity of 45 xxx
patients from the THCA data for focused analysis. The other 15 patients
were used to validate the network, obtaining a mean squared error (MSE)
value, to evaluate the precision of the network.

For identification of the best initial conditions, 25 different networks
are generated, each one with 2 hidden layers and different combinations
of neurons per layer. For each combination the MSE is calculated and the
3 combinations with the lowest MSE are selected for selection of the
best initial conditions regarding the weights and biases. For each of
the 3 networks 100 random initial conditions are tested, resulting in
one network with the lowest MSE.
