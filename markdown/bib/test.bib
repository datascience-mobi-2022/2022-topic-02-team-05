   abstract = {The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased worldwide over the past four decades. TC is divided into three main histological types: differentiated (papillary and follicular TC), undifferentiated (poorly differentiated and anaplastic TC), and medullary TC, arising from TC cells. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms associated to the pathogenesis of different types of TC and their clinical relevance. In the last years, progresses in the genetic characterization of TC have provided molecular markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment targets. Recently, papillary TC, the most frequent form of TC, has been reclassified into two molecular subtypes, named BRAF-like and RAS-like, associated to a different range of cancer risks. Similarly, the genetic characterization of follicular TC has been proposed to complement the new histopathological classification in order to estimate the prognosis. New analyses characterized a comprehensive molecular profile of medullary TC, raising the role of RET mutations. More recent evidences suggested that immune microenvironment associated to TC may play a critical role in tumor invasion, with potential immunotherapeutic implications in advanced and metastatic TC. Several types of ancillary approaches have been developed to improve the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration biopsies in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Finally, liquid biopsy, as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for body fluid genotyping, brings a new prospective of disease and therapy monitoring. Despite all these novelties, much work remains to be done to fully understand the pathogenesis and biological behaviors of the different types of TC and to transfer this knowledge in clinical practice.},

The protocol comprises three major steps: definition of a gene list from omics data, determination of statistically enriched pathways, and visualization and interpretation of the results. We describe how to use this protocol with published examples of differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes; however, the principles can be applied to diverse types of omics data. The protocol describes innovative visualization techniques, provides comprehensive background and troubleshooting guidelines, and uses freely available and frequently updated software, including g:Profiler, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Cytoscape and EnrichmentMap.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. CONCLUSIONS: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

   abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Patients with other, more rare subtypes of thyroid cancer-medullary and anaplastic-are ideally treated by physicians with experience managing these malignancies. Targeted treatments that are approved for differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers have prolonged progression-free survival, but these drugs are not curative and therefore are reserved for patients with progressive or symptomatic disease.},

   abstract = {The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in the regulation of metabolism, oxygen consumption, and the release of energy in the form of heat to maintain the body. Even at rest, these processes are sensitive to changes in thyroid function. This means that along with the adrenergic system, thyroid function determines the organism's ability to adapt to cold. Cold adaptation causes deiodination of thyroxine (T(4)) and thus promotes an increase in blood triiodothyronine (T(3)) levels in humans and animals. Triiodothyronine is an inductor of iodothyronine deiodinase expression in brown fat, liver, and kidney. Iodothyronine deiodinase plays an important role in adaptation of the organism to cold by contributing to high adrenergic reactivity of brown fat. T(3) also leads to an increase in expression of uncoupling proteins and uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and an increase in heat production. The aim of this article is to review the available literature regarding the role of thyroid hormones in adaptation to cold and to present the current knowledge of the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying their action during cold adaptation.},

METHODS: We have performed a review of the more aggressive variants of PTC with respect to main characteristics, histological and molecular features, and the consequences that the knowledge of these variants should have in the treatment of the patients. RESULTS: At the present time, we do not know the prognostic value of these aggressive PTC variants. The extent of the surgical treatment and adjuvant therapy necessary should be decided on the basis of the extent of the tumor at presentation and the opinion of experienced clinicians. CONCLUSION: These aggressive variants should be known by clinicians, to avoid underdiagnosis, and treated according to the latest recommendations in the literature.},

   abstract = {Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most frequently occurring human thyroid cancer with good prognosis following appropriate treatment. Lymph node (LN) metastases are the main way through which PTC spread cancer cells. The mechanisms underlying PTC with local invasion, LN metastases and distant metastases are not well investigated. Tumor secrete cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and -D bind to VEGF receptors on lymphatic endothelial cells and induce proliferation (budding) from nearby lymphatic capillaries and growth of new lymphatic capillaries. About one-third of patients can be diagnosed at the time of surgical findings. Different image studies, such as ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration cytology, scintigraphic localization and positron emission tomography were reported to detect LN metastases. Important factors in predicting LN metastases are vascular invasion, male gender, absence of tumor capsule, and perithyroid involvement. Tumor recurrence in LN after primary treatment of PTC had an independent and highly significant negative effect on survival in patients over 45 year-old. Recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer of sVEGFR3-Fc is a feasible therapeutic scheme for blocking lymphogenous metastasis. In conclusion, aggressive surgical procedures performed by experienced surgeons or postoperative radioactive iodine therapy to minimize local recurrence of LN for PTC patients with high risk.},

   abstract = {Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.},

   abstract = {Deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and UNC5 function as netrin dependence receptors by inducing apoptosis in the absence of their ligand and accordingly were recently designated as putative conditional tumor suppressors. Herein, we determined whether netrin-1 and its receptors are implicated in cancer cell invasion and tumor progression. Expression of DCC, UNC5 and adenosine A2B-receptors (A2B-Rs) was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in human colon cancer cells. The impact of DCC restitution and netrin-1 was evaluated on collagen type I invasion, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice, cancer cell survival and gene expression profiling. Flow cytometry, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 and caspase-8 activation were used to evaluate the impact of DCC on cell death. Both netrin-1 and A2B-R activation induced the invasive phenotype through the Rho-Rho kinase axis in DCC-deficient human colorectal cancer cells. Restitution of wild-type DCC blocked invasion induced by netrin-1, A2B-R agonist and other agents. Ectopic expression of netrin-1 led to increased growth of human colon tumor xenografts in athymic mice. Conversely, introduction of wt-DCC in kidney MDCKts.src-ggl cells strongly inhibited metastasis in lymph nodes and lungs and increased sensitivity to apoptosis in hypoxia. DNA microarrays revealed that netrin and DCC had common and divergent impacts on gene expression linked to cell cycle, survival, surface signaling and adhesion. Our findings underscore that netrin is a potent invasion and tumor growth-promoting agent and that DCC is a metastasis suppressor gene targeting both proinvasive and survival pathways in a cumulative manner.},

   abstract = {Approximately 4,000 Lys and Arg methylation sites have been identified in human proteins to date, most of which are on non-histone proteins.The mapping of methyltransferase–substrate networks indicated that a large array of cellular functions is regulated by protein methylation, ranging from chromatin structure remodelling to gene transcription, DNA repair, protein synthesis, RNA metabolism, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and signal transduction.Crosstalk often occurs between phosphorylation and methylation, and between two neighbouring methylated residues. This may result in the enhancement or repression of protein function and cellular processes.Methylation has emerged as an important modulator of cell signalling. Lys or Arg methylation of regulatory proteins in the MAPK, WNT, BMP, Hippo and JAK–STAT signalling pathways were shown to modulate signalling sensitivity, strength, or duration.Methylation signals on histone and non-histone proteins may regulate each other to affect nuclear processes. Proteins that contain a methyl-lysine- or methylarginine-binding domain often function as hubs of signalling integration or diversification. Examples are found in the regulation of nuclear factor-κB and p53 transcriptional activity by methylation.The size of the methylproteome may be as large as that of the tyrosine phosphoproteome. Advances in mass spectrometry and related technologies are speeding up the characterization of the methylproteome and the elucidation of its functions in health and disease.},

   abstract = {Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP) is the only known ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Ron. The MSP/Ron pathway is involved in several important biological processes, including macrophage activity, wound healing, and epithelial cell behavior. A role for MSP/Ron in breast cancer has recently been elucidated, wherein this pathway regulates tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Here, we review the recent literature surrounding MSP/Ron function in tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and osteoclasts - cell types that often coexist in breast tumor microenvironments. We discuss the potential implications of MSP/Ron activity occurring concurrently in these cell types on tumor progression and metastasis. Lastly, we outline the potential for targeting MSP/Ron as a novel therapy for breast cancer, and for other cancer types.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrin α6β4 is a known tumor antigen; however, its function in different subtypes of thyroid cancer is not known. This study reports that α6β4 expression is selectively up-regulated in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells, the most malignant subtype of human thyroid cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the contribution of α6β4 in ATC progression, cell proliferation, motility and soft agar assay were performed in vitro and a xenograft tumor growth assay was performed in vivo. RESULTS: Knockdown of β4 integrin subunit expression by shRNA in ATC cells reduced the proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth of ATC cells in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that integrin α6β4 contributes to the development of aggressive forms of thyroid cancer with poor prognostic potential, such as ATC, and thus may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment for this subtype of thyroid cancer.},

   abstract = {The IL-36 subfamily of cytokines belongs to the IL-1 superfamily and consists of three pro-inflammatory agonists IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, and an IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) antagonist, IL-36Ra. These IL-36 cytokines function through a common receptor to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-36 cytokines are expressed as inactive precursors and require proteolytic processing to become fully active. Upon binding to IL-36R, IL-36 agonists augment the expression and production of inflammatory cytokines via activating signaling pathways. IL-36 is mainly expressed in epidermal, bronchial, and intestinal epithelial cells that form the barrier structures of the body and regulates the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production at these tissue sites. Dysregulation of IL-36 signaling is a major etiological factor in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Besides its critical role in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis, emerging evidence suggests that aberrant IL-36 activities also promote inflammatory diseases in the lung, kidneys, and intestines, underscoring the potential of IL-36 as a therapeutic target for common inflammatory diseases. The role of IL-36 signaling in cancer development is also under investigation, with limited studies suggesting a potential anti-tumor effect. In this comprehensive review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the expression, activation, regulatory mechanisms, and biological functions of IL-36 signaling in immunity, inflammatory diseases, and cancer development.},

   abstract = {Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here, we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem (ES) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. We find that histologically poorly differentiated tumors show preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES cells, combined with preferential repression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers, this ES-like signature is associated with high-grade estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The ES signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of ES cell-associated transcription regulators that are highly expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with ES cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes shown by many tumors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive adult primary cancer in the central nervous system. Therapeutic approaches for GBM treatment are under intense investigation, including the use of emerging immunotherapies. Here, we propose an alternative approach to treat GBM through reprogramming proliferative GBM cells into non-proliferative neurons. METHODS: Retroviruses were used to target highly proliferative human GBM cells through overexpression of neural transcription factors. Immunostaining, electrophysiological recording, and bulk RNA-seq were performed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuronal conversion of human GBM cells. An in vivo intracranial xenograft mouse model was used to examine the neuronal conversion of human GBM cells. RESULTS: We report efficient neuronal conversion from human GBM cells by overexpressing single neural transcription factor Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), Neurogenin-2 (Neurog2), or Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1). Subtype characterization showed that the majority of Neurog2- and NeuroD1-converted neurons were glutamatergic, while Ascl1 favored GABAergic neuron generation. The GBM cell-converted neurons not only showed pan-neuronal markers but also exhibited neuron-specific electrophysiological activities. Transcriptome analyses revealed that neuronal genes were activated in glioma cells after overexpression of neural transcription factors, and different signaling pathways were activated by different neural transcription factors. Importantly, the neuronal conversion of GBM cells was accompanied by significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo models. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GBM cells can be reprogrammed into different subtypes of neurons, leading to a potential alternative approach to treat brain tumors using in vivo cell conversion technology.},

   abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) enhances prostate cancer (CaP) growth and metastasis in vivo. PTHrP also increases cell survival and migration, and upregulates pro-invasive integrin α6β4 expression. We used the human CaP cell lines C4-2 and PC-3 as model systems to study the mechanisms via which PTHrP regulates α6β4 levels. We report that PTHrP regulates α6 and β4 levels via a transcriptional pathway; β4 regulation involves the NF-κB pathway. PTHrP also regulates β4 levels at the post-translational level. PTHrP inhibits caspase-3 and -7 activities. Post-translational regulation of β4 by PTHrP is mediated via attenuation of its proteolytic cleavage by these caspases. Since α6 dimerizes with β4, increased β4 levels result in elevated α6 levels. Suppressing β4 using siRNA attenuates the effect of caspase inhibition on apoptosis and cell migration. These results provide evidence of a link between PTHrP, integrin α6β4 levels as a function of caspase activity, and cell survival and migration. Targeting PTHrP in CaP cancer, thereby reversing the effect on caspase activity and α6β4 levels, may thus prove therapeutically beneficial.},
