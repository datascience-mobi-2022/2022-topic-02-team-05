# Introduction

2019 230,000 humans died from cancer in germany xxx \[[Krebsrate und Krebs-Sterberate in Deutschland (krebsinformationsdienst.de)](https://www.krebsinformationsdienst.de/tumorarten/grundlagen/krebsstatistiken.php)\]. To detect tumors and fight them, the development of new treatment and detection methods is essential. Therefore it is inevitable to find a tumors mutational cause. Therefore transcriptomic profiling methods like RNA-seq can be used.

The provided data in the following analysis originates from transcriptomic profiling methods like RNA-seq. Transcriptomic profiling sequences all the RNA that has been generated by transcription of a cells DNA. The difference to sequencing of DNA is, that it only sequences those genes, that are going to be expressed in that cell. Quelle the cell xxx

## Hallmarks of cancer

The Hallmarks of Cancer are properties of tumors, that can be detected in each tumor. Among others resisting cell death, inducing angiogenesis, enabling replicative immortality, activating invasion and metastasis evading growth suppressors were the first detected hallmarks. xxx [Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation: Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00127-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411001279%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

### Histological tumor types

The observed tumors can be classified into different histological types. Carcinomas contain adenocarcinomas, Squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma and carcinomas in general, which include all of the mixed carcinomas. Carciomas derive from epithelial cells. Melanoma is a tumor of the skin, a sarcoma derives from connective or supportive tissue cells. A glioblastoma is a tumor in the brain and leukemia affects the blood. xxx Quelle: The cell Seite 1092

#### RNA-seq

RNA-seq is performed by cleaning of RNA, fragmentation, translation of RNA to cDNA, sequencing of cNDA and comparing with the reference genome. The advantage of RNA-seq is that it includes information about gene expression, that is especially important in the analysis of tumors such as epigenetic changes (e.g. epigenetic gene silencing) or fusion proteins.

The results from RNA-seq used for the analysis originate from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)

## Thyroid carcinoma

Thyroid carcinoma (THCA) incidence increased dramatically over the past few years (<https://jamanetwork.com/data/journals/intemed/936342/m_ied170005f1.png>) xxx, that is, why we take a closer look at the genes causing THCA.

The main tasks of the thyroid gland are, to synthesize hormones, to regulate body temperate and metabolism. A lack of thyroid hormones can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea and depression ([Thyroxine - Higher - Coordination and control - The human endocrine system - Edexcel - GCSE Biology (Single Science) Revision - Edexcel - BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3gxb82/revision/3#:~:text=Thyroxine%20is%20produced%20from%20the%20thyroid%20gland%2C%20which,development.%20Its%20levels%20are%20controlled%20by%20negative%20feedback.) xxx). Because a Thyroid cancer derives from thyroid cells and thereby destroys the thyroid gland, it causes a lack of thyroid hormones.

Thyroid cancer can occur in 2 different types, differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Those two types have histological subtypes. Papillary/classical thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and tall cell variant (TCV) cancer are subtypes of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), while medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer are subtypes of undifferentiated thyroid cancer (UTC). DTCs occur more often than UTCs. That is, why only the DTCs occur in the following analysis. xxx [Update on Fundamental Mechanisms of Thyroid Cancer - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32231639/)

Regarding the presented DTCs, PTCs have the best clinical prognosis ( [Risk Patterns of Distant Metastases in Follicular, Papillary and Medullary Thyroid Cancer-BIOSIS Previews (webofscience.com)](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/biosis/full-record/BIOSIS:PREV202200394234)) xxx, while TCV cancers have the worst clinical outcome xxx ([Papillary Thyroid Cancer-Aggressive Variants and Impact on Management: A Narrative Review-BIOSIS Previews (webofscience.com](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/biosis/full-record/BIOSIS:PREV202000606704)). Therefore, the detection of the tumor type would be important and for more specific therapy options. Even though, all thyroid cancers are treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine, the additional therapy differs for each histological type ([New therapeutic advances in the management of progressive thyroid cancer-BIOSIS Previews (webofscience.com)](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/biosis/full-record/BIOSIS:PREV201000061254)) xxx.

RODRIGUES_DCC_TARGETS_UP is a gene set containing oncogenes found in colon cancer. Those genes are upregulated in colon cancer cells and thereby promote metastasis, tumor cell survival and invasion. By identifying the upregulation of those genes in a cancer, additional therapies can be started to suppress tumor survival, tumor growth and invasion. xxx ([Opposing roles of netrin-1 and the dependence receptor DCC in cancer cell invasion, tumor growth and metastasis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17334389/)) If this upregulation can also be detected in THCA, therapies, that are used in colon cancer may be useful for therapy of THCA.

#### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To analyse and compare the activity of pathways of gene expression data, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is performed. The aim of the GSEA is to analyse and to identify highly expressed pathways \cite{GSEAxxx}. For this, two conditions with replicates are compared, so a reference of normal expression data is needed.\\
First, a gene list is defined. Then the statistically enriched pathways are identified and lastly, the results are visualized.\\
GSEA is performed with the package 'fgsea' ref(xxx).

#### Gene Set Variation Analysis

The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is performed with the same intention as the GSEA, with the difference, that there is no reference expression data needed like in the GSEA. Because there was no expression data provided for comparison in the TCGA analysis, GSVA was used. There are various solutions to perform GSVA, one of them is performed by Hänzelmann et al xxx by following those five steps.

For performing a GSVA, firstly the cumulative density distribution of a gene over all samples is estimated. Then the expression statistic of a gene in a sample based on the cumulative density distribution is calculated to bring all of the expression values to the same level. The third step is to rank the genes based on the expression statistic and the normalize the ranks with z-transformation. The last step is to compute the enrichment score based on the obtained ranked list. Therefore the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like rank statistic is calculated for each gene set. That is used to calculate the enrichment score for each pathway in each patient, which is shown a a heatmap.

BMC Bioinformatics 14 (1): 7. <https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7.>

GSVA is performed with the package xxx.

#### **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction**

The Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) is a method to reduce the dimension of a multidimensional data set. Compared to the PCA, the structure of the data in higher dimensions is maintained. Thereby the UMAP keeps the overall structure of the data set, therefore clusters are easier to identify.

The problem of the UMAP is, that although the overall structure is conserved, the distance between the individual points is not proportional to the real distance in the data set.

UMAP is performed with the package xxx.

#### Principal component analysis

A Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of a given data set. The dimensions are summarized in principal components (PCs) which do not correlate. Because the PCs summarize the dimensions, the first PCs explain most of the variance of the data set and thereby can be selected to explain the data. Still, one has to keep in mind, that by reducing the dimensions, not all of the variance is explained and some of the information is lost in the process. The ideal number of PCs can be determined with an elbow-plot. In our analysis we use a PCA as a foundation for the UMAP, because the UMAP can not work with correlated dimensions. Furthermore it is used to detect the most important pathways, which explain most of the first PCs.

In the analysis, a PCA is performed for the pan cancer analysis on the TCGA gene expression data, to find similarities and differences in pathway activity for each tumor type. Furthermore a PCA is performed for the focused analysis of THCA and normal tissue.

PCA is performed with xxx.

### Jaccard index

The Jaccard index is the Intersection, divided by the union of two sets.

### Our Analysis

In the following 2 analyses are performed, a pan cancer analysis and a focused analysis about THCA.

#### Pan Cancer Analysis

For the pan cancer analysis 3 data sets are provided. One containing expression data of 60,000 genes in 10,000 tumor patients, another one with clinical annotations concerning those patients and one with hallmark pathways and their included genes. In the following analysis this data is cleaned by removing NAs, biotype filtering and low-variance filtering. After that a descriptive analysis is performed. Those two steps lead to the actual analysis, a gene set variation analysis to detect significantly altered pathways compared to the other pathways in tumor tissue. In the end a linear regression analysis is performed to predict pathway activity based on other pathways??? xxx Furthermore a neuronal network is built to improve prediction.

#### Focused analysis on THCA patients

Furthermore a analysis of THCA patients is performed. For this analysis a data set containing the gene expression of 60 patients in tumor an normal tissue and their clinical annotations. First the data is cleaned and described like the pan cancer data, to prepare the data for the gene set variation analysis, which is also performed for the THCA data in the bigger pan cancer data set, to confirm results from the smaller data set. In this analysis a linear regression analysis is performed to predict the activity of thyroxine biosynthesis. The results are also improved with a neuronal network.

### Linear regression analysis

A linear regression analysis is performed to predict the activity of xxx based on the activity of the other pathways.

Firstly, the correlation of the pathways for predicting is checked, only pathways with a low correlation were kept. In the next step, the variance is checked, 80% of the genes with low variance were omitted.

For the regression analysis only 20% of the pathways were used, to only use significant pathways.

The regression analysis was tested by
