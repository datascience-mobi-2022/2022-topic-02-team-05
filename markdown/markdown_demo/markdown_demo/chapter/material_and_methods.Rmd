# Material and Methods

## Our data sets

For the analysis four data sets were provided.

The first data set is a Gene expression data frame. The Gene expression data frame contains 60,000 genes and and their expression in 10,000 patients. It is derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The expression of the genes was obtained by RNA-seq. 

The second data frame contains 37 clinical annotations like Tumor type, age, gender, etc. for each of the 10,000 patients from the Gene expression data frame.

The third object is a list that contains five lists for the focused analysis, one list for each tumor type (BRCA, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD, THCA). For the focused analysis, the THCA data was used. The THCA data contains 3 data frames, each one with information about the same 60 patients. The first data is a gene expression matrix from THCA tissue, the second data contains the gene expression from normal tissue and the third data frame contains the clinical annotations like age and gender. Gene expression data was obtained by RNA-seq.

The fourth object contains 46 pathways involved in phenotypes partly included in the hallmarks of cancer and the genes involved in those pathways.

## Metabolic pathway selection

From the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) \cite{xxx} metabolic pathways were selected. First, they were compared to the given Hallmark-Pathways in order to select pathways that differ to the Hallmark-Pathways. The goal was to identify more pathways, that are important for the development of cancer. Therefore it was important that as many genes from the selected pathways as possible are also included in the provided Hallmark pathways. To identify the relevant pathways, the intersection of genes was calculated and the genes with an intersection of at least 99% were maintained for further analysis. 

xxx??????????????????????

To avoid duplicates in between the metabolic pathways and between the Hallmark pathways and the metabolic pathways, the pathways were checked for duplicates with the Jaccard index. Pathways with a sum of Jaccard indices beyond the 1-sigma range were discarded.

## Preprocessing

### Deleting Not Available Values (NA's)

Deleting of NA's was done with the R-function na.omit(x).

### Low-Variance Filtering

Low variance filtering is performed to delete genes with a low variance in gene expression from the data set.
It is performed to delete genes that are expressed the same in all cancer types (pancancer analysis) or the same in normal cells.
To calculate the variance of the gene expression of a gene, the r-function var(x) is used and genes with a lower variance than a certain threshold value are removed.\\
For the focused analysis the variance of the gene expression for each gene in tumor tissue was calculated. Genes with a variance beneath a certain threshold were deleted in the data sets of tumor and normal tissue.

### Biotype Filtering

The biotype filtering was conducted for the pancancer data and the focussed analysis data. The biotype of each gene was determined (protein coding, RNA,...) and compared with the biotypes of pathways. To allow an appropriate comparison of the expression data and further reduce the data, only biotypes were kept that are available in the pathways. The biotype can be determined with the R-function checkbiotypes(x) from the package biomaRt \ref{biomaRt}.

#### Selection of metabolic pathways

(da eine hohe jaccard summe eine hohe überschneidung mit anderen pathways bedeutet. In einer heatmap sind hohe Jacccard indices weiß bis rot gefährbt. Ein niedriger Jaccard index ist blau gefärbt.)

To test for duplicate pathways in the selected metabolic pathways compared to the hallmark pathways and the compared tp the metabolic pathways themselves, the Jaccard index between to pathways were calculated.\\
There were a few duplicates between the metabolic and Hallmark pathways. Those metabolic pathways with a high Jaccard index were discarded. The success of the cleaning was checked by again calculating the Jaccard index between the metabolic and the hallmark pathways. The values of the Jaccard index were then illustrated in a heatmap \ref{xxxfigure heatmap}. It can be assumed, that the selection of relevant pathways was successful because the pathways differ between each other. The number of metabolic pathways could be reduced from xxx to 600.

## Descriptive analysis

### Mean-variance plot

In a mean-variance plot the variance is plotted against the mean of expression values of the single genes. Therefore, the variance and mean were calculated by the R-function var(x) and mean(x).

### Violin plot

To check the distribution of a data set and compare it with other data sets violin plots are used. Violin plots are tilted and mirrored density plots of gene expression values. The y-axis shows the gene expression value and the x-axis shows the amount of genes with a certain gene expression value.

#### Volcano plot

A volcano plot is used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. In the following analysis a volcano plot is used to identify which genes are significantly diferentially expressed in the analysed THCA tissue, compared to the analysed normal tissue. Therefore the mean of each gene is calculated for normal and THCA tissue and used for the calculation of the Log2-Foldchange (Log2FC) in the following way:

$$
log2FC = mean(normal tissue) - mean(tumor tissue)
$$ In the next step, a two-sided t test was performed to determine the significance of a difference in expression.

To avoid the accumulation of type 1 errors, a bonferroni correction was performed. n is the number of genes in the cleaned data set for focused analysis:

$$
\alpha = \frac{0.025}{n}
$$

In the volcano plot the -log10 of the calculated p values is plotted against die Log2FC. Genes with a a lower p-value than the corrected alpha-value are significantly differentially expressed. If the Log2FC is additionally higher than 0.1, the genes are significantly over expressed in tumor tissue, if the Log2FC is higher lower than -0.1, the genes are significantly under expressed in tumor tissue.

## Comparing of Pathways

After reducing the number of Genes of the Gene Expression data frame and the THCA data by data cleaning, a descriptive analysis was performed with a Mean-variance plot and five violin plots of the TGCA data frame. The descriptive analysis of the THCA data was performed with a volcano plot and the distribution of the Tumor-specific data was displayed with violin plots.

### PCA

The package xxx is used to perform the PCA. Therefore the data obtained from the GSEA was used. After performing the PCA, the results were plotted to visualize the different clusters.

The PCA was performed for pathway and gene activity. For analysis of the gen activity the package xxx was used.

Dazu wurde noch analysiert, wie die Pathways auf die PCs verteilt sind.

### Figure X

To identify pathways with the highest p-Value, obtained from GSVA and t-testing, a figure x is generated.

For generating figure x, the data from generating a volcano plot is used to identify the pathways, that are significantly over- or underexpressed based on the p-value. Pathways with a p-value smaller than 0.025 and a log2FC bigger than zero are significantly overexpressed, if the log2FC is smaller than zero, the pathways are significantly underexpressed. In the next step, the pathways are ranked based on their p-value and the -log10(p-value) of each pathways is plotted against its rank. One plot is generated for overexpressed pathways and the other one for under expressed pathways.
